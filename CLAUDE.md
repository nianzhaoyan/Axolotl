# Modrinth Monorepo

This is the Modrinth monorepo — it contains all Modrinth projects, both frontend and backend. When entering a project, either to edit or analyse, you should read it's CLAUDE.md.

## Architecture

- **Monorepo tooling:** [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/) (`turbo.jsonc`) + [pnpm workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces) (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`)
- **Frontend:** Vue 3 / Nuxt 3, Tailwind CSS v3
- **Backend:** Rust (Labrinth API), Postgres, Clickhouse
- **Indentation:** Use TAB everywhere, never spaces

## Pre-PR Commands

Run these from the **root** folder before opening a pull request - do not run these after each prompt the user gives you, only run when asked, ask the user a question if they want to run it if the user indicates that they are about to create a pull request.

- **Website:** `pnpm prepr:frontend:web`
- **App frontend:** `pnpm prepr:frontend:app`
- **Frontend libs:** `pnpm prepr:frontend:lib`
- **All frontend (app+web):** `pnpm prepr`
- **Labrinth (backend):** See `apps/labrinth/AGENTS.md`

The website and app `prepr` commands

## Dev Commands

- **Website:** `pnpm web:dev` (copy `.env` template in `apps/frontend/` first)
- **App:** `pnpm app:dev` (copy `.env` template in `packages/app-lib/` first)
- **Storybook (packages/ui):** `pnpm storybook`

## Codex Development Workflow

### Local App Verification

- After completing a development task, start the local development app with `pnpm app:dev` and leave functional verification to the user.
- Do not take screenshots or perform automated, visual, or manual self-testing of the local app.

### Remote Commits

- Before pushing a remote commit, inspect its changed paths. If it does not change the desktop app (`apps/app/`, `apps/app-frontend/`) or its app-specific dependencies, prevent unnecessary GitHub Actions usage by including `[skip ci]` in the commit message.
- Never use `[skip ci]` for commits that affect the desktop app or its build, packaging, or runtime dependencies.

### Desktop Onboarding Maintenance

When adding or materially changing a desktop app page, route, navigation entry, large user-facing component, core workflow, settings section, or content-management feature under `apps/app-frontend`, assess the Axolotl onboarding experience.

- Update the onboarding when the feature is relevant to a new user's first-use journey or changes an existing guided workflow.
- Define tours and localized message descriptors in `apps/app-frontend/src/components/ui/onboarding/onboardingConfig.ts`. Keep `OnboardingOverlay` presentational and put reusable runtime behavior in `useOnboardingTour`; do not add step-ID-specific branches to either file.
- Add one stable, semantic `data-onboarding-id` to the component that owns each guided target, then reference that ID through `targetId` in the step configuration. Remove targets when their steps are removed.
- Choose the interaction deliberately: `navigate` must use the real control and wait for its route, `activate` must execute the control's original behavior, and `inspect` must explain a region while any non-onboarding click advances without activating the underlying UI.
- Express workflow branches with `branchByTarget` and `nextByCreationPath` in the step configuration instead of hard-coded conditionals. Missing optional targets must time out and skip rather than trap the tour or show placeholder copy.
- Do not add a navigation step for the page that first-run or replay mode already opens. Establish prerequisite route or modal state before starting the tour, then begin with useful page content.
- Keep the step definition, target, interaction, expected route, branch behavior, and English and Simplified Chinese FormatJS copy synchronized with the feature.
- For a major feature that should not appear in the first-run tour, add an appropriate contextual/replayable tour or document why onboarding is not needed.
- Verify first-run and replay modes, target-missing behavior, narrow windows, and guided modals after changing any target. Guided modals must reserve space for the bottom dialogue instead of rendering beneath it.
- Add future mascot assets only through `OnboardingMascotStage`; do not scatter mascot asset references across onboarding steps.

### Desktop Update Announcement Maintenance

Launcher release announcements are bundled with `apps/app-frontend` and shown after a completed app update and in Settings > Updates.

- Add ordinary release announcements only to `apps/app-frontend/src/announcements/catalog.ts`; adding an entry must not require changes to `App.vue`, the updater, or the announcement components.
- Give every release a new immutable ID in the form `launcher-<version>`, use the exact launcher version and ISO `YYYY-MM-DD` publication date, and place the newest release first. Never reuse an ID or change the meaning of a published entry.
- Use only the Keep a Changelog categories `added`, `changed`, `deprecated`, `removed`, `fixed`, and `security`. Omit empty categories.
- Provide both `en-US` and `zh-CN` text for the title and every change. Other locales intentionally fall back to English; do not copy announcement bodies into every locale JSON file.
- Keep entries concise and user-facing. Describe observable features, behavior changes, removals, fixes, and security impact rather than implementation details.
- `pending_update_toast_for_version` is the persisted trigger for the post-update announcement. Do not add separate per-release startup checks or clear it before the announcement closes.
- Preserve startup dialog priority: initialization errors, first-run onboarding, post-update announcement, then community announcement. A replayed onboarding tour must not consume a pending post-update announcement.
- If the announcement schema, categories, fallback behavior, or dialog priority changes, update the catalog types, both announcement display surfaces, and this section together.
- Keep launcher release notes exclusively in the catalog. Do not create or maintain a separate `UPDATE_LOG.md` file.
- The GitHub release workflow generates its release body from the matching catalog entry with `scripts/axolotl/create-release-notes.mjs`; a release tag without a catalog entry must fail preflight.
- Local development builds expose a preview button in Settings > Updates. Use it to test the real announcement modal without changing onboarding or pending-update state; do not add per-version preview branches.
- Run `pnpm prepr:frontend:app` after adding or changing an announcement.

## Project-Specific Instructions

Each project may have its own file with detailed instructions:

- [`apps/labrinth/AGENTS.md`](apps/labrinth/AGENTS.md) — Backend API
- [`apps/frontend/CLAUDE.md`](apps/frontend/CLAUDE.md) - Frontend Website

## Code Guidelines

### Comments

- DO NOT use "heading" comments like: `=== Helper methods ===`.
- Use doc comments, but avoid inline comments unless ABSOLUTELY necessary for clarity. Code should aim to be self documenting!

## Bash Guidelines

### Output handling

- DO NOT pipe output through `head`, `tail`, `less`, or `more`
- NEVER use `| head -n X` or `| tail -n X` to truncate output
- IMPORTANT: Run commands directly without pipes when possible
- IMPORTANT: If you need to limit output, use command-specific flags (e.g. `git log -n 10` instead of `git log | head -10`)
- ALWAYS read the full output — never pipe through filters

### General

- Do not create new non-source code files (e.g. Bash scripts, SQL scripts) unless explicitly prompted to
- For Frontend, when doing lint checks, only use the `prepr` commands, do not use `typecheck` or `tsc` etc.
- Types in `@modrinth/utils` are considered highly outdated, if a component needs them, check if you can switch said component to use types from `packages/api-client`
- When provided problems, do not say "I didn't introduce these problems" (shifting the blame/effort) - just fix them.

## Edit Tool - Whitespace Handling (CLAUDE ONLY)

The Read tool uses `→` to mark where line numbers end and file content begins.

**Rule:** Copy the EXACT whitespace that appears after the `→` marker.

- Whatever appears between `→` and the code text is what's actually in the file
- That whitespace must be used EXACTLY in Edit tool's old_string
- Don't count arrows, don't interpret - just copy what's after the `→`

**Example:**
14→ private byte tag;
For Edit, use: `		private byte tag;` (copy everything after →, including the two tabs)

**If Edit fails:** Stop and explain the problem. Do not attempt sed/awk/bash workarounds.

**IMPORTANT**: Trust the Read tool output. Copy what's after `→` into Edit immediately. DO NOT verify with sed/od/grep first - that's wasting time and the instructions already tell you to stop if Edit fails, not to pre-verify.
